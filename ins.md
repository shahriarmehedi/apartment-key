I'm giving the client feedback please update regarding this:

-It's something about the top portion, the Hero page that doesn't match the rest of the website
-Everything else is Perfect just need to the the Hero in with the rest
-My first thought is we need to incorporate that blue somehow without overpowering the Hero page
-The deep blue, that will tye everything together
-not too much blue, just accent
-I actually like that the Hero page doesn't have a blue background. It looks fun and exciting
-But because the blue is so heavy throughout we need to add a touch more of the blue for Hero
-to balance out
-What if we added a transparent deep blue to the locations instead of the transparent white
-Just need to blend Hero with rest of the page. Just dont know what to do because i still like the brightness of Hero but need a little blue to balance. Without looking so heavy

Please read them and implement the changes accordingly. Let me know if you need any further clarification.
